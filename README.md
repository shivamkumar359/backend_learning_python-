Each project is **independent** and focuses on **one concept at a time**.

## Projects and what I learned

### Project 1: Calculator

This project helped me understand basic backend logic.

What I worked on:
- Taking user input
- Handling operators
- Controlling program flow

What I learned:
- How logic moves step by step
- Why backend code must handle invalid input
- How small mistakes break programs

---

### Project 2: Data Type Validation

After the calculator, I realized that backend systems cannot trust user input.

This project focuses only on validation.

What I worked on:
- Checking input types
- Handling incorrect input safely
- Using Python data structures for validation

What I learned:
- Why validation is critical in backend systems
- How to prevent errors before processing
- How data types affect logic

---

### Project 3: Data Type Checking Inside the Calculator

This project combines Project 1 and Project 2.

What I worked on:
- Integrating validation into an existing program
- Improving safety of the calculator
- Reusing logic instead of rewriting code

What I learned:
- Backend workflows (validate → process → output)
- Importance of modular code
- How real backend systems are layered

---

### Project 4: Gradient Descent Basics

This project is not about machine learning frameworks.
It is about understanding optimization logic.

What I worked on:
- Gradient descent on simple functions
- Effect of learning rate
- Visualizing optimization steps

What I learned:
- How optimization works internally
- Why slope equals zero at the minimum
- Why this concept matters for ML-based backends

## How this repository will grow

This repository will continue to grow as I learn:

- File handling and persistence
- APIs (Flask / FastAPI)
- Databases
- Backend systems that interact with ML models

---

## Final note

This repository reflects **learning in progress**.

The code is not perfect.
The structure will improve over time.
The focus is on understanding, not speed.
