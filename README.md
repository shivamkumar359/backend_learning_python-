# Backend Learning with Python 🐍

This repository documents my **backend development learning journey using Python**.  
I am organizing my learning in a **project-based structure**, where each project focuses on one core backend concept and builds on the previous one.

The repository contains:
- Python backend logic
- Data type handling and validation
- Workflow-oriented thinking
- Mathematical foundations used in backend and ML systems
- Small but meaningful backend-style projects

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Learn backend development fundamentals using Python
- Understand how data flows through backend systems
- Practice clean and structured Python code
- Build a strong foundation before moving to APIs and databases
- Maintain a clear learning history with projects and workflows
